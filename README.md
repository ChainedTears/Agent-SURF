# 🏄 Agent SURF 🌐

**Agent SURF** is an advanced automation tool designed to complete tasks, scrape data, and more on your computer using AI. Using powerful technologies like **Playwright, AppleScript, Powershell**, it takes user prompts (tasks) and breaks them down into actionable steps. The execution agents then follow these steps to efficiently complete the desired actions. Say goodbye to repetitive tasks—Agent SURF does it all for you!
